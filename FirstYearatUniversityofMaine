<TITLE>First Year at University of Maine</TITLE>

<P> My first year thus far at the University of Maine has been absolutely incredible.  I enjoyed the school at but never really believed it would become my second home as much as it has so far.  The connections I have made, even just in my first semester, I know will last my entire life.  The classes I have taken are incredible, the experiences I have made are unforgettable, and there is absolutely no place I would rather be to further my education. </P>
