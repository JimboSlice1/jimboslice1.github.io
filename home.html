<DIV>First Year Finance Student at the University of Maine</DIV>

<P> Howdy, my name is James Perez.  I am from Stockholm, New Jersey which is way up in northern New Jersey.  <A HREF="Running.html"> Running</A> has always been a big part of my life as I ran cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track throughout high school plus I swam competitively over the summer.  I also enjoy playing basketball and hockey with friends as well as watching hockey.  My <A HREF="Family.html"> family </A> consists of my parents, myself, my four sisters and my pets.  I decided to come up to the University of Maine and am currently a first year studying finance.  Thus far, my <A HREF="First year at University of Maine"> first year at University of Maine </A> has been incredible, and I certainly hope it stays that way. </P>
