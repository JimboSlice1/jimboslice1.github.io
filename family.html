<TITLE> My Family </TITLE>

<P> I come from a relatively large family consisting of four sisters, two parents, plus our two pets.  I am the second oldest in the family, so I have an older sister and four younger sisters.  The age order of my family is my father being the oldest, then my mother, then older sister, Angela, who is twenty, then I am nineteen, then my younger sisters are seventeen, thirteen, and seven.  Possibly the most important part of the family is our pets, Bella is our dog and Trixie is our cat.  In addition to my family that lives at home, a large amount of my family all live in the same community as I do.  My aunt and uncle live down the street, then a bit farther down from them is my grandfather, then a bit farther down from him is my cousin. </P>
