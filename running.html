<TITLE> Running Throughout High School </Title>

<P> Cross country was definitely my favorite time of running out of the three seasons of sports in high school.  Freshman year, we placed first at sectionals, second at groups, and we were fourth in New Jersey.  Sophomore year, we placed first at sectionals, third at groups, and we were top twenty in the state.  Junior year, we won sectionals, placed third at groups, and were again top twenty in New Jersey.  Senior year, we won sectionals for the fourth straight year, placed second at groups by one point, and once again, we were top twenty in the state.  Indoor track on the other hand was my least favorite time to run.  It was bitterly cold outside, and then when we ran inside for the meets it was incredibly hot and dry.  The times I ran during indoor track were significantly slower than those I ran in outdoor for the same events.  Indoor track was taken as a preseason for outdoor track to get more training in and to build a strong base.  Outdoor track was where I ran almost all of my track personal bests.  They were not the best times, but they were enough to keep me in great shape going back into the summer and the cross country season so that I could race fast. </P>
