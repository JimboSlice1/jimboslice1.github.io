<H1> Cross Country </H1>

<P>  Cross country was definitely my favorite time of running out of the three seasons.  Freshman year, we placed first in our section, second in our group, and ended up being fourth in all of New Jersey and ninth in the Northeast.  Sophomore year, my first year on varsity, we won sectionals, third at groups, and placed in the top twenty in New Jersey.  Junior year we won sectionals, placed second at groups, and again, we were top twenty in New Jersey.  Senior year we were able to pull off another sectional win, to make us undefeated for our high school careers, as well as place seond at groups by one point, and again being top twenty in New Jersey. </P>

<H2> Indoor Track </H2>

<P> Indoor track was probably my least favorite time to run.  It was bitterly cold outside, making it hard to put in the mileage we needed to, and then when we raced it was incredibly dry because we were running inside.  The times I ran in indoor track were significantly slower than those in outdoor track.  But I took indoor track as more of a preseason and preparation for outdoor track.  </P>

<H3> Outdoor Track </H3>

<P> Outdoor track was a fun time of the year because it was beginning to warm up a bit so we could run back outside once again.  Outdoor track is where I was able to run all of my track personal bests.  For the mile, I was able to break five minutes and run 4:58, for the two mile I was able to run eleven minutes, and for the half mile, I was able to run a 2:12.  These are not the greatest times, but they made me happy and helped prepare me for cross country, my favorite season of all. </P>
