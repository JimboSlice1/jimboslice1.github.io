<TITLE> Running Throughout High School </TITLE>

<P> Cross country was definitely my favorite time of running out of the three seasons.  Freshman year, we placed first in our section, second in our group, and ended up being fourth overal in New Jersey and ninth in the Northeast.  Sophomore year, my first year on varsity, we won sectionals, placed third at groups, and finished top twenty in New Jersey.  Junior year we won sectionals, placed second at groups, and again, we were top twenty in New Jersey.  Senior year we were able to pull off another sectional win, making us undefeated at sectionals for our high school careers, we placed second at groups by one point, and again placed top twenty in New Jersey.  Indoor track on the other hand was probably my least favorite time to run.  It was bitterly cold ouside, making it hard to put in the high mileage we needed to, and then when we raced it was incredibly dry because we were running indoors.  The times I ran in indoor track are, for the most part, significantly slower than the times I ran in outdoor track.  As a result, I took indoor track mostly as just a preseason for outdoor track, to stay in shape.  Outdoor track was a much more fun time when we did not have to bundle up and wear masks due to the coldness.  Outdoor track is when it began to warm up.  Outdoor track is where I ran almost all of my track personal bests, and even though all my best times were in outdoor, I still took outdoor track as a preparation for cross country, my favorite season of all. </P>
