<H1> My Big Family </H1>

<P> I come from a relatively large family consisting of four sisters, two parents, as well as our two pets.  I am the second oldest in the family, so I have an older sister and three younger sisters.  The age order of my family is my father being the oldest, then my mother, then my older sister Angela, then me, after that it goes Grace, Gianna, and last but not least, Elizabeth.  My sisters and my current ages are twenty, nineteen, seventeen, thirteen, and seven.  An important part of the family is our pets, Bella and Trixie, who help make my house louder and much more fun.  In addition to those who live at home, my aunt, uncle, and cousins live down the street, my other cousin lives down the street as well, and then my grandfather lives just a few short minutes away as well. </P>
