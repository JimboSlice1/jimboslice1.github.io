<TITLE> ABOUT ME </TITLE>

<P> Howdy, my name is James Perez. I am from Stockholm, New Jersey which is way up in northern New Jersey.  <A HREF="running.html"> running </A> has always been a big part of my life as I ran cross country, indoor track, and outdoor track throughout high school plus competed in swimming over the summer.  I enjoy playing as well as watching hockey in my free time with my friends.  My <A HREF="family.html"> family </A> consists of my parents, myself, my four sisters, and my cat and dog. I decided to come up to the University of Maine for college and I am a first year student studying finance.  Thus far, my <A HREF="firstyearatumaine.html"> first year at University of Maine </A> has been incredible, and I hope it continues that way. </P>
