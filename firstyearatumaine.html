<TITLE> First Year at University of Maine </TITLE>

<P> My first year at the University of Maine has been absolutely incredible thus far.  I enjoyed the school very much when I went on my visits, but I never believed I would fall in love with it so much and for it to truly become my second home.  The connections I have made, even just in my first year, will last my entire life.  Even just one semester in, I know I have found some soulmates and best friends.  The classes I am in are incredible, the experiences have been unforgettable, and there is absolutely no place I would rather be to further my education. </P>
